Team Members:

Problem:
- Plastic watter bottle polution
- Most people do not drink enough water every day and are chronically dehydrated

What our app does:
- Our app lets users find water fountains in Vancouver and also keep track of their water intake

How our app works: 
- Users enter their name and weight to get started
- Their weight is used to calculate their ideal water intake amount
- Then users will be able to add how much water they drank during the day
- Clicking the map icon will bring the user to our map 
- Clicking the settings icon will log the user out
- Users can search for a water fountain location and see the fountain's information
- When a fountain is selected, users can get directions to that fountain
- Current location may not work on emulator, but works on a phone
